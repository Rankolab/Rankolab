# Rankolab System Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 03, 2025

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements and design for the Rankolab system. Rankolab aims to be an all-in-one AI-powered platform designed to automate website creation, SEO optimization, content generation, and performance monitoring, primarily targeting users who want to build and manage niche websites efficiently.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers the core components of the Rankolab ecosystem:

*   **WordPress Plugin:** The primary interface for users to interact with the system on their websites.
*   **Backend API:** The central engine providing data management, processing logic, and integration with external services.
*   **Official Website (Rankolab.com):** The public-facing website for information, user registration, license purchase, blog, and potentially user account management.
*   **Mobile Apps (Android/iOS):** Companion apps for monitoring website performance and receiving notifications.
*   **Admin Panel:** A separate interface for system administrators to manage users, licenses, and monitor the platform.

### 1.3 Vision

Rankolab envisions simplifying the process of building profitable niche websites by leveraging AI for design, content creation, SEO, and ongoing management. It aims to provide users with a powerful toolkit accessible through a WordPress plugin, supported by a robust backend and user-friendly interfaces (website, mobile apps).

## 2. System Overview

Rankolab operates as a distributed system where different components interact via a central Backend API:

1.  **User Interaction:** Users primarily interact with the system via the **WordPress Plugin** installed on their site. They also use the **Official Website** for purchasing licenses and accessing information, and the **Mobile Apps** for monitoring.
2.  **Plugin Workflow:** The plugin guides the user through setup (license validation, domain analysis), website design selection, content planning, automated content generation, publishing, link building logging, and performance monitoring.
3.  **Backend API:** This Laravel-based service manages user data, website configurations, content, metrics, licenses, and orchestrates tasks like interacting with external AI/SEO APIs (though current implementation is limited). It provides RESTful endpoints for all client components (Plugin, Website, Apps, Admin Panel).
4.  **External APIs:** The system relies heavily on third-party APIs for functionalities like SEO analysis (e.g., Moz, SEMrush), keyword research (e.g., Google Keyword Planner), content generation (e.g., OpenAI/GPT, Hugging Face), image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion), social media posting (e.g., Twitter API), search console integration (Google Search Console API), and potentially payment processing (e.g., Stripe).
5.  **Data Storage:** A relational database (e.g., MySQL) stores all system data managed by the Backend API.
6.  **Admin Panel:** A separate web application allows administrators to manage the platform and its users via dedicated backend API endpoints.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 WordPress Plugin

*   **Installation & Activation:** Standard WordPress plugin installation. Activation triggers a setup wizard.
*   **Setup Wizard:**
    *   **Introduction:** Welcome screen with links to the official website.
    *   **License Validation:** Prompt for license key, validate against the backend API (`POST /license/validate`). Provide links to purchase.
    *   **Domain Analysis:** Analyze the current WordPress site's domain. If existing, fetch and display metrics (DA, SEO score, backlinks, speed) via backend API (`GET /websites/{id}/metrics` - requires backend to fetch live data). If new, suggest relevant niches based on domain name (requires backend niche suggestion logic).
    *   **Website Registration:** Register the current site with the backend (`POST /websites`) if not already done.
*   **Website Design Module:**
    *   Allow users to select a niche (if new site).
    *   Present website design templates, color schemes, typography, layouts.
    *   **Goal:** Upon selection, the *plugin* (potentially using backend data/APIs) should configure the WordPress site: apply theme/template, create core pages/menus/categories, install necessary plugins (e.g., WooCommerce), generate initial SEO-optimized content and images for the site structure.
    *   Allow users to provide prompts for design changes (potentially via an integrated chatbot).
    *   Store selected design preferences via backend API (`POST /websites/{id}/design`).
*   **Monetization Setup:**
    *   Ask user about intent to monetize with Google AdSense.
    *   Provide recommendations and potentially assist with AdSense code placement (plugin-level functionality).
*   **Content Planning Module:**
    *   Perform keyword research, competitor analysis, and identify keyword gaps (requires backend integration with SEO APIs).
    *   Present a draft content plan (topics, keywords, content types, volume, schedule).
    *   Allow users to review, adjust, and approve the plan.
    *   Store the final plan via backend API (`POST /websites/{id}/content-plan`).
*   **Content Generation Module:**
    *   **RSS Feed Management:** Allow users to add and configure RSS feeds (`POST /websites/{id}/rss-feeds`). Fetch content from feeds, optimize it based on website context, and potentially use it for content generation (requires backend feed processing logic).

    *   Suggest link building opportunities (requires backend analysis logic).
    *   Provide tools/guidance for strategies (guest posts, directories, comments).
    *   Allow users to log link building activities (`POST /websites/{id}/links`).
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   Display an overview of website metrics, content status, performance, and recent activity.
    *   Fetch data from various backend endpoints (`/metrics`, `/performance`, etc.).
*   **AI Chatbot ("Charlotte"):**
